# National Park Campgrounds

This project is a script that retrieves campground information for a given national park using the Recreation Information Database (RIDB) API. The script fetches data from the API and generates a CSV file containing details about campgrounds, activities, and campsites.

## Prerequisites

- [API Key](#api-key): You will need an API key from the RIDB API to access the data.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for Python version)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for Node.js version)

The script will generate a `national_parks.csv` file containing the campground information for the specified park.

### API Key

To access the campground data from the RIDB API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain an API key:

1. Visit the [RIDB API website](https://ridb.recreation.gov/) and create an account (if you don't have one).

2. Go to your account settings and navigate to the API Keys section.

3. Generate a new API key for your application.

4. Copy the generated API key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` in the code with your actual API key.
